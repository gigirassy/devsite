Welcome to my web development services!

I like to code. So I offer site development for at sliding scale, especially geared towards Transformers-related websites. >:]

## Rules
* My minimum per hour is $15, but you can pay whatever feels right after that. I suggest 50 dollars for full webdev jobs that take 2-3 hours, and 25 dollars for minor touchups.
* I refuse to do development for bigots, transmisics[1], scammers, and anything of the sort. Basically, if you'd hate my Autigender therian acearo white-passing Native identity, you aren't welcome to hire me. Accordingly, your profiles will be subjected to a vibe check.
* You must have a good reputation in the Transformers fandom, such as a well-rated storefront presence or good feedback.
* For commerce shops, you must have the appropriate stuff set up for your shop to function. For WordPress, this includes a WooCommerce subscription. I will not pay for it for you.
### Important!
* My main method of payment for this is me and my mom's shared PayPal account, and I do not have a bank account of my own. However, my email is linked to it as well. If this is out of your comfort zone, I don't suggest hiring me.

## Services I can do
* Grammar cleanup and correction for website pages
* Listing importing (IE: to eBay from WordPress; you must provide an CSV)
* Wordpress theming using existing themes
* Accessibility checkups

## I'm experienced in...
* Basic Wordpress (*not* theme development)
* Docker
* Static site generators, IE Zola
* HTML/CSS
* Markdown
* Spreadsheets (CSV, Excel, etc.)
* Basic accessibility, like contrast, alt text, etc.

I have experience with the grand majority of the general internet as I've been using computers for three-fourths of my life.

## Contact methods

* TFW2005 (preferred): A board for Transformers stuff. Send me a message [here](https://www.tfw2005.com/boards/conversations/add?to=nune).
* Email: My name, plus @imap, and the final suffix .fi added to the end.

[1] I prefer to use the suffix -misic/-misia to refer to bigotry, as phobias are stigmatized conditions people struggle with.
